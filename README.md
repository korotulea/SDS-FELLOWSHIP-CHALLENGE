# SDS FELLOWSHIP CHALLENGE

GROUP 1 Challenge 1
Creating Artificial Dataset
Week 1-2 

You are working as a Data Scientist in SDS-Fellowship, a fresh startup company that delivers insights from Data.

As a part of your training, you have to create an Artificial Dataset containing the specifications shown in the Excel file provided. It may sound easy, but the deliverables of this challenge are multiple!

This will be the first step of GROUP 1 of the series of SDS Fellowship Challenges. After completing this task the dataset that collects the most "likes" from the fellow students will be the dataset we will all work on in our next challenge.
